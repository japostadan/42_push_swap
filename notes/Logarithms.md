# Logarithms

Logarithms log are flip of exponentials. In simple terms it is the undoing an exponentation. It is the answer in the question - ("How many times in need to multiply a  certain number (base) to get another number"?).

Basic Example:

Let's take the logarithm of 1000 with base 10:
log⁡101000=3
log10​1000=3

This means that 10 must be multiplied by itself 3 times to get 1000.
10×10×10=1000
10×10×10=1000

Here, 10 is the base, 1000 is the number we want to reach, and the answer (3) is how many times we need to multiply 10 by itself to get 1000.


#### Key Components
	- Base 10: This is the most common logarithm, and its calles the common logarithm. log10​x.
	- Base 2: This is use in computer science, especially when talking about binary systems, abd is called the binary logarithm.log2​x.
	- Natural logarithm: This uses the base e(approx 2.718) and is used in many areas of mathematics. It is denoted ad lnx.
